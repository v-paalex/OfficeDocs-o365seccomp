# Restrict access to content by using encryption in sensitivity labels

When you create a sensitivity label, you can restrict access to content that the label will be applied to. For example, with the encryption settings for a sensitivity label, you can protect content so that:

- Only users within your organization can open a confidential document or email.
- Only users in the marketing department can edit and print the promotion announcement document or email, while all other users in your organization can only read it.
- Users cannot forward an email or copy information from it that contains news about an internal reorganization.
- The current price list that is sent to business partners cannot be opened after a specified date.

When a document or email is encrypted, access to the content is restricted, so that it:

- Can be decrypted only by users authorized by the label’s encryption settings.
- Remains encrypted no matter where it resides, inside or outside your organization, even if the file’s renamed.
- Is encrypted both at rest (for example, in a OneDrive account) and in transit (for example, a sent email).

The encryption settings are available in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center > **Labels** page > **Sensitivity** tab > **Create a label**.

## How encryption works

Encryption uses Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS). Azure RMS uses encryption, identity, and authorization policies. To learn more, see [What is Azure Rights Management?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/what-is-azure-rms)

## How to turn on encryption for a sensitivity label

To begin, simply toggle **Encryption** to **On**, and then use the options below to control who can acess email or documents to which this label is applied. You can:

1. **Apply encryption to both email and documents, or just email.** If you choose just email, messages with this label will be encrypted in Outlook, but documents with this label won't be encrypted in other apps, such as Word or PowerPoint. 
2. **Allow access to labeled content to expire**, either on a specific date or after a specific number of days after the label is applied. After this time, users won’t be able to open the labeled item. If you specify a date, it is effective midnight on that date in your current time zone. 
3. **Allow offline access** never, always, or for a specific number of days after the label is applied. If you restrict offline access to never or a number of days, when that threshold is reached, users must be reauthenticated and their access is logged. For more information, see the next section on the Rights Management use license.

### Rights Management use license for offline access

When a user opens a document or email offline that’s been protected by a sensitivity label, an Azure Rights Management use license for that content is granted to the user. This use license is a certificate that contains the user's usage rights for the document or email, and the encryption key that was used to encrypt the content. The use license also contains an expiration date if this has been set, and how long the use license is valid.

If no expiration date has been set, the default use license validity period for a tenant is 30 days. For the duration of the use license, the user is not reauthenticated or reauthorized for the content. This lets the user continue to open the protected document or email without an Internet connection. When the use license validity period expires, the next time the user accesses the protected document or email, the user must be reauthenticated and reauthorized.

In addition to reauthentication, the policy and user group membership is reevaluated. This means that users could experience different access results for the same document or email if there are changes in the policy or group membership from when they last accessed the content.

To learn how to change the default 30-day setting, see [Rights Management use license](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/configure-usage-rights#rights-management-use-license).

## Assign permissions to specific users or groups

You can grant permissions to specific people so that only they can interact with the labeled content.

Doing so is a straightforward two-step process:

1. First you add users or groups that will be assigned permissions to the labeled content.
2. Then you choose which permissions those users have for the labeled content.

![Options to assign permissions to users](media/Sensitivity_Assign_permissions_settings.png)

### Add users or groups

When you assign permissions, you can choose:

- Everyone in your organization (all tenant members). This setting excludes guest accounts.
- Any specific user or email-enabled security group, distribution group, Office 365 group, or dynamic distribution group. 
- Any email address or domain outside your organization, such as gmail.com, hotmail.com, or outlook.com.

When you choose all tenant members or browse the directory, the users or groups must have an email address.

As a best practice, use groups rather than users. This strategy keeps your configuration simpler.

### Choose permissions

When you choose which permissions to allow for those users or groups, you can select either:

- A [predefined permissions level](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/configure-usage-rights#rights-included-in-permissions-levels) with a preset group of rights, such as Co-Author or Reviewer.
- A Custom group of rights, where you choose whichever permissions you want.

For more information on each specific permission, see [Usage rights and descriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/configure-usage-rights#usage-rights-and-descriptions).  

![Options to choose preset or custom permissions](media/Sensitivity_Choose_permissions_settings.png)

Note that the same label can grant different permissions to different users. For example, a single label can assign some users as Reviewer and a different user as Co-author, as shown below.

To do this, add users or groups, assign them permissions, and save those settings. Then repeat these steps, adding users and assigning them permissions, saving the settings each time. You can do this as often as necessary, to define different permissions for different users.

### Rights Management issuer (user applying the sensitivity label) always has Full Control

Encryption for a sensitivity label uses Azure RMS. When a user applies a sensitivity label to protect a document or email by using Azure RMS, that user becomes the Rights Management issuers for that content.

The Rights Management issuer is always granted Full Control permissions for the document or email, and in addition:

- If the protection settings include an expiration date, the Rights Management issuer can still open and edit the document or email after that date.
- The Rights Management issuer can always access the document or email offline.
- The Rights Management issuer can still open a document after it is revoked.

For more information, see [Rights Management issuer and Rights Management owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/configure-usage-rights#rights-management-issuer-and-rights-management-owner).

## Storing encrypted content in OneDrive and SharePoint

Be aware that when encryption is applied to files stored in OneDrive and SharePoint, the service cannot process the contents of these files. This means that features such as co-authoring, eDiscovery, search, Delve, and other collaborative features do not work. Also, data loss prevention (DLP) policies can work only with the metadata (including Office 365 labels) but not the contents of encrypted files (such as credit card numbers within files).

This applies only to content stored in OneDrive and SharePoint. In Exchange Online, transport rules use the [super user account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/configure-super-users) so that they can scan encrypted content and enforce DLP policies.

## Important prerequisites

Before you can use encryption, you might need to perform these tasks.

### Activating Azure Rights Management

To use encryption in sensitivity labels, the Azure Rights Management service needs to be activated in your tenant. In newer tenants, the service is on by default, but you might need to manually activate the service. For more information, see [Activating Azure Rights Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/activate-service).

### Configure Exchange for Azure Information Protection

Exchange does not have to be configured for Azure Information Protection before users can apply labels in Outlook to protect their emails. However, until Exchange is configured for Azure Information Protection, you do not get the full functionality of using Azure Rights Management protection with Exchange.
 
For example, users cannot view protected emails on mobile phones or with Outlook on the web, protected emails cannot be indexed for search, and you cannot configure Exchange Online DLP for Rights Management protection. 

To ensure that Exchange can support these additional scenarios, see the following:

- For Exchange Online, see the instructions for [Exchange Online: IRM Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/configure-office365#exchange-online-irm-configuration).
- For Exchange on-premises, you must deploy the [RMS connector and configure your Exchange servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/deploy-rms-connector).
