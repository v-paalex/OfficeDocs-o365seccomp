# Search the Office 365 audit log to troubleshoot common scenarios



## Using the Office 365 audit log search tool

Each of the troubleshooting scenarios described in this article are based on using the Office 365 audit log search tool in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center. This section lists the permissions requirements to search the audit log and describes the steps to access and run audit log searches. Each scenario provides specific guidance about how to configure the search query and what to look for in the detailed information in the audit records that match the search criteria.

### Permissions required to use the audit log search tool

You have to be assigned the View-Only Audit Logs or Audit Logs role in Exchange Online to search the Office 365 audit log. By default, these roles are assigned to the Compliance Management and Organization Management role groups on the **Permissions** page in the Exchange admin center. For more information, see [Manage role groups in Exchange Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=730688).

### Running audit log searches

This section describes the basics for creating and running audit log searches. Use these instructions as a starting point for each troubleshooting scenario in this article. For more detailed step-by-step instructions, see [Search the audit log in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center ](search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance.md#step-1-run-an-audit-log-search).

1. Go to [https://protection.office.com](https://protection.office.com).
  
2. Sign in to Office 365 using your work or school account.

3. In the left pane of the Security &amp; Compliance Center, click **Search & investigation** > **Audit log search**.
    
    The **Audit log search** page is displayed. 
    
    ![Configure criteria and then click Search to run the search](media/8639d09c-2843-44e4-8b4b-9f45974ff7f1.png)
  
4. You can configure the following search criteria. Note that each troubleshooting scenario in this article will recommend specific guidance for configuring these fields.
    
    a. **Activities** - Click the drop-down list to display the activities that you can search for. After you run the search, only the audit log entries for the selected activities are displayed. Selecting **Show results for all activities** will display results for all activities that meet the other search criteria. You'll also have to leave this field blank return audit records from the Exchange admin audit log.
    
    b. **Start date** and **End date** - Select a date and time range to display the events that occurred within that period. The last seven days are selected by default. The date and time are presented in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. The maximum date range that you can specify is 90 days.

    c. **Users** - Click in this box and then select one or more users to display search results for. The audit log entries for the selected activity performed by the users you select in this box are displayed in the list of results. Leave this box blank to return entries for all users (and service accounts) in your organization. 
    
    d. **File, folder, or site** - Type some or all of a file or folder name to search for activity related to the file of folder that contains the specified keyword. You can also specify a URL of a file or folder. If you use a URL, be sure the type the full URL path or if you just type a portion of the URL, don't include any special characters or spaces. Leave this box blank to return entries for all files and folders in your organization.
    
5. Click **Search** to run the search using your search criteria. 
    
    The search results are loaded, and after a few moments they are displayed under **Results** on the **Audit log search** page. Each to the following sections will provide guidance about things to look for the specific troubleshooting scenario. 

    For more information about viewing, filtering, or exporting audit log search results, see: 

    - [View search results](search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance.md#step-2-view-the-search-results)
    - [Filter search results](search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance.md#step-3-filter-the-search-results)
    - [Export search results](search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance.md#step-4-export-the-search-results-to-a-file)

## Finding the IP address of the computer used to access a compromised account

The IP address corresponding to an activity performed by any user is included in most audit records. Information about the client used is also included in the audit record.

Here's how to configure an audit log search query for this scenario:

**Activities** - If relevant to your case, select a specific activity to search for. Otherwise, leave this field blank to return audit records for all activities.

**Start date** and **End date** - Select a date range that's applicable to your investigation.

**Users** - If you're investigating a compromised account, select the user whose account was compromised. This will return audit records for activities performed by that user account.

**File, folder, or site** - Leave this field blank.

After you run the search, the IP address for each activity is displayed in the **IP address** column in the search results. Click the record in the search results to view more detailed information on the flyout page.

## Determining if email forwarding has been set up for a user

When email forwarding is configured for a mailbox, which forwards email messages that are sent to the mailbox. Messages can be forward to users inside or outside of your organization. When email forward is set up on a mailbox, the underlying Exchange Online cmdlet that used is **Set-Mailbox**.

Here's how to configure an audit log search query for this scenario:

**Activities** - Leave this field blank so that the search returns audit records for all activities. This is necessary to return any audit records related to the **Set-Mailbox** cmdlet.

**Start date** and **End date** - Select a date range that's applicable to your investigation.

**Users** - Unless you're investigating a email forwarding issue for a specific user, leave this field blank. This will help you identify if email forwarding was set up for any user.

**File, folder, or site** - Leave this field blank.

After you run the search, click **Filter results** on the search results page. In the box under **Activity** column header, type **Set-Mailbox**. Note that only auditing records related to the **Set-Mailbox** cmdlet are displayed. 

![Filtering the results of an audit log search](media/emailforwarding1.png)

At this point, you have to look at the details of each audit record that's displayed to determine if the activity it's related to email forwarding. To do that, click the audit record to display the **Details** flyout page, and then click **More information**. The following screenshot and descriptions highlight the information that indicates email forwarding was set on the mailbox.

![Detailed information from the audit record](media/emailforwarding2.png)

a. In the **ObjectId** field, the alias of the mailbox that email forwarding was set on is displayed. This mailbox is also displayed on the **Item** column in the search results page.

b. In the **Parameters** field, The value *ForwardingSmtpAddress* indicates that email forward has been set on the mailbox. In this example, mail is being forwarded to the email address mike@contoso.com, which is outside of the alpinehouse.onmicrosoft.com organization.

c. The *True* value for the *DeliverToMailboxAndForward* parameter indicates that a copy of message delivered to sarad@alpinehouse.onmicrosoft.com *and* is forwarded to the email address specified by the *ForwardingSmtpAddress* parameter, which in this example is mike@contoso.com. If the value for this parameter is set to *False* then email is only forwarded to the email address specified by the *ForwardingSmtpAddress* parameter. It is not delivered to the mailbox specified in the **ObjectId** field.

d. The **UserId** field indicate the user who set email forwarding on the mailbox specified in the **ObjectId** field field. This user is also displayed in the **User** column on the search results page. In this case, it seems that the owner of the mailbox set email forwarding on her mailbox.

If you determine that email forwarding shouldn't be set on the mailbox, you can remove email forwarding by running the following command in Exchange Online PowerShell:

```
Set-Mailbox <mailbox alias> -ForwardingSmtpAddress $null 
```

See the [Set-Mailbox](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/set-mailbox) cmdlet reference topic for more information about the parameters related to email forwarding.

## Determining if a user deleted email items

Before audit log records about deleted email items are saved to the Office 365 audit log, mailbox auditing has to be enabled for each user mailbox in your organization. Additionally, the SoftDelete and HardDelete mailbox actions have to be enabled for auditing. For instructions, see [Enable mailbox auditing in Office 365](enable-mailbox-auditing.md). If mailbox auditing is already enabled for users, use the following steps to search the audit log for events related to deleted email items.

Here's how to configure an audit log search query for this scenario:

**Activities** - Under **Exchange mailbox activities**, select one or both of the following activities:

- **Deleted messages from Deleted Items folder** -  This activity corresponds to the **SoftDelete** mailbox auditing action. This activity is also logged when a user permanently deletes an item by selecting it and pressing **Shift+Delete**. After an item is permanently deleted, the user can recover it until the deleted item retention period expires.

- **Purged messages from mailbox** - This activity corresponds to the **HardDelete** mailbox auditing action. This is logged when a user purges an item from the Recoverable Items folder. Admins can use the Content Search tool in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center to search for and recover purged items until the deleted item retention period expires or longer if the user's mailbox is on hold.

**Start date** and **End date** - Select a date range that's applicable to your investigation.

**Users** - If you select a user in this field, the audit log search tool will return audit records for email items that were deleted (SoftDeleted or HardDeleted) by the user you specify. In some cases, the user who deletes an email might not be the mailbox owner.

**File, folder, or site** - Leave this field blank.

After you run the search, you can filter the search results to display the audit records for soft-deleted items or for hard-deleted items. Click the audit record to display the **Details** flyout page, and then click **More information**. Additional information about the deleted item, such as the subject line and the location of the item when it was deleted, is displayed in the **AffectedItems** field. The following screenshots show an example of the **AffectedItems** field from a soft-deleted item and a hard-deleted item.

**Example of AffectedItems field for soft-deleted item**

![Audit log record for soft-deleted item](media/softdeleteditem.png)

**Example of AffectedItems field for hard-deleted item**

![Audit log record for hard-deleted email item](media/harddeleteditem.png)

### Recovering deleted email items

Users can recover soft-deleted items if the deleted items retention period has not expired. In Exchange Online, the default deleted items retention period is 14 days, but admins can increase this setting to a maximum of 30 days. Point users to the [Recover deleted items or email in Outlook Web App](https://support.office.com/article/Recover-deleted-items-or-email-in-Outlook-Web-App-C3D8FC15-EEEF-4F1C-81DF-E27964B7EDD4). topic for instructions on recovering deleted items.

As previously explained, admins might be able to recover hard-deleted items if the deleted item retention period has not expired or if the mailbox is on hold, in which case items are retained until the hold duration expires. When you run a content search, soft-deleted and hard-deleted items in the Recoverable Items folder are returned in the search results if they match the search query. For more information about running content searches, see [Content Search in Office 365](content-search.md).

> [!TIP]
> To search for deleted email items, search for all or part of the subject line that's displayed in the **AffectedItems** field in the audit log record.

## Determining if a user created an inbox rule

When users create, edit, or delete an inbox rule for their Exchange Online mailbox, a corresponding audit record is saved to the audit log. For more information about inbox rules, see:

- [Use inbox rules in Outlook on the web](https://support.office.com/article/use-inbox-rules-in-outlook-on-the-web-8400435c-f14e-4272-9004-1548bb1848f2)
- [Manage email messages in Outlook by using rules](https://support.office.com/article/Manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-C24F5DEA-9465-4DF4-AD17-A50704D66C59)

Here's how to configure an audit log search query for this scenario:

**Activities** - Under **Exchange mailbox activities**, select **New-InboxRule Create/modify/enable/disable inbox rule**.

**Start date** and **End date** - Select a date range that's applicable to your investigation.

**Users** - Unless you're investigating a specific user, leave this field blank. This will help you identify new inbox rules set up by any user.

**File, folder, or site** - Leave this field blank.

After you run the search, any audit records for this activity are displayed in the search results. Click an audit record to display the **Details** flyout page, and then click **More information**. Information about the settings of the inbox rule are displayed in the **Parameters** field. The following screenshot and descriptions from the audit record highlight the information about inbox rules.

![Audit log record for new inbox rule](media/NewInboxRuleRecord.png)

a. In the **ObjectId** field, the full name of the inbox rule is displayed. This name includes the alias of the user's mailbox (for example, SaraD) and the name of the inbox rule (for example, "Move messages from admin").

b. In the **Parameters** field, the condition of the inbox rule is displayed. In this example, the condition is specified by the *From* parameter. The value defined for the *From* parameter indicates that the inbox rule acts on email sent by admin@alpinehouse.onmicrosoft.com. For a complete list of the parameters that can be used to define conditions of inbox rules, see see [New-InboxRule](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/new-inboxrule).

c. The *MoveToFolder* parameter specifies the action for the inbox rule; in this example, messages received from admin@alpinehouse.onmicrosoft.com will be moved to the folder named *AdminSearch*. Also see  [New-InboxRule](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/new-inboxrule) for a complete list of parameters that can used to define the action of an inbox rule.

d. The **UserId** field indicate the user who created the inbox rule specified in the **ObjectId** field. This user is also displayed in the **User** column on the search results page.
